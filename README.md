## 🚀 About Me

I’m a third-year Software Engineering student with a clear focus on **Backend development**.  
I build backend features and services through academic and personal projects, working mainly with **Java and Spring Boot**, relational databases, and containerized environments.

In parallel, I serve as a **Team Lead in the Magshimim Cyber Program**, where I mentor student teams, guide technical decisions, and support structured development processes.

---

## 🧠 Core Technical Focus

- Backend feature development (APIs, business logic, authentication)
- RESTful API design and clean service structure
- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Containerized applications with Docker
- Version control and team workflows with Git
